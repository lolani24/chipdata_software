# ðŸ”¬ GCAT - Graphene Chip Assurance Tracker #
## âœ¨ Description ##
GCAT (Graphene Chip Assurance Tracker) is a Flask-based web application developed for a research lab focused on graphene biosensors. The platform was created to streamline data collection and quality assurance during the chip fabrication process. It provides an intuitive interface to store, manage, and visualize data such as voltage measurements and microscopic images for each batch of graphene chips.

By organizing this data in a centralized, searchable database, GCAT helps researchersâ€”especially PhD studentsâ€”quickly identify issues, track performance trends, and make informed decisions to improve chip fabrication outcomes. The project features custom HTML designs that mimic the chip layout, making it user-friendly and visually aligned with the lab's workflow.
