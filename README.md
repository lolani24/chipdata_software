# 🔬 GCAT - Graphene Chip Assurance Tracker #
## ✨ Description ##
GCAT (Graphene Chip Assurance Tracker) is a Flask-based web application developed for a research lab focused on graphene biosensors. The platform was created to streamline data collection and quality assurance during the chip fabrication process. It provides an intuitive interface to store, manage, and visualize data such as voltage measurements and microscopic images for each batch of graphene chips.

By organizing this data in a centralized, searchable database, GCAT helps researchers—especially PhD students—quickly identify issues, track performance trends, and make informed decisions to improve chip fabrication outcomes. The project features custom HTML designs that mimic the chip layout, making it user-friendly and visually aligned with the lab's workflow.
## 🧰 Tech Stack ## 
* Languages: Python, HTML CSS
* Framework: Flask (backend), Bootstrap (frontend)
* Libraries:
  * Jinja2 (Flask templating)
  * SQLite
## 🚀 Features ##
* 🧩 Interactive Chip Map – Visual representation of the chip layout on a wafer, allowing users to click on individual chips to view or enter data.

* 📝 QA Data Entry – Easy-to-use forms for entering quality assurance data such as voltage measurements and notes.

* 🗃️ Centralized Database Storage – All data is saved in a structured database, ensuring traceability and easy access to historical records.

* 🌐 Web-Based Access – Designed as a website so PhD students and lab members can access data from any device, anywhere.

* 🧪 Research-Focused Design – Tailored for biosensor research workflows, helping identify fabrication issues faster and improve chip quality over time.

## 🚧 Future Improvements ## 
* 🗄️ Better Database System – Explore and implement a more scalable database solution, like AWS or a managed database, to handle larger datasets and ensure better performance.

* 🔐 User Authentication – Add a login system to manage access to the data and restrict certain actions to authorized users only.

* 📤 Batch Uploading – Allow batch uploading of data (voltage measurements, images) to streamline the process for larger datasets.

* ⚠️ Error Handling & Validation – Implement more robust error handling, input validation, and data integrity checks for smoother user experience.

* 📝 Testing and Documentation – Add unit tests and improve the code documentation for better maintainability.

* 🌐 Hosting – Research and implement a more efficient hosting solution, including deployment to a production environment with proper scaling and uptime.
